# My E-commerce Vue.js shop
## The files are in the branch "master"

>I am building this project from scratch.
Pure CSS, Vue and Firebase.
SVG files from undraw.io.

I decided to create an e-commerce store with Vue.js and Firebase. 
I also created a UI / UX project in Figma, which can be found at this address - https://bit.ly/34pu973
